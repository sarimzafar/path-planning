# path-planning
This repository holds the code for path planning using spline library

## [Demo](https://youtu.be/F57NrBqrm7Y)

#### The car travels the path around the speed limit of 50mph without any collisions
#### The car avoids obstacles/other cars on the same lane by changing lanes or slowing down when no free lanes are available
